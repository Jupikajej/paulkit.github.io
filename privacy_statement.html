<h1><strong>Privacy&nbsp;</strong><strong>Policy</strong></h1>

<p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application (&ldquo;App&rdquo;) for mobile devices that was created by PaulCK. <strong>BY USING THE APP, YOU AGREE TO THE PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THE APP.</strong></p>

<h3>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the App?</h3>

<p>We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</li>

<li>to advertisers and third party advertising networks and analytics companies as described in the section below</li>
</ul>
<h3>Automatic Data Collection and Advertising</h3>
<p>We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the App is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. We work with advertisers and third party advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in the App which helps us keep the cost of the App low. Advertisers and advertising networks use some of the information collected by the App, including, but not limited to, the unique identification ID of your mobile device and your mobile telephone number. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use an encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties can't identify you personally. These third parties may also obtain anonymous information about other applications you've downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile websites you visit, your non-precise location information (e.g., your zip code), and other non- precise location information in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the App and elsewhere. We may also share encrypted versions of information you have provided in order to enable our partners to append other available information about you for analysis or advertising related use.</p>
<p>If you'd like to opt-out from third party use of this type of information to help serve targeted advertising, please visit the section entitled Opt-out below. </p>

<h3>What are my opt-out rights?</h3>
<p>Opt-out of all information collection by uninstalling the App: You can stop all collection of information by the App easily by uninstalling the App. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. </p>

<h3><strong>Children&#39;s Information</strong></h3>

<p>The App is intended for a general audience. No content is directed specifically at children under the age of 13. PaulCK is committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children&rsquo;s privacy online. Registration for the App is restricted by the Licensing Agreement. If PaulCK learns or has reason to suspect that a user of the App is under the age of 13, any personal information obtained from that user will be removed from the App.</p>

<h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3>

<p>The App communicates and facilitates communications between users through telephone or email communication. The App may collect information related to such communication. You agree for someone from or on behalf of PaulCK to contact you by any means provided for contact through your use of the App.</p>

<h3><strong>Third Parties</strong></h3>

<p>This privacy policy only applies to information collected by PaulCK from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether registered users of this App or through other sites throughout the Internet, this privacy policy does not apply. PaulCK does not control the privacy policies or other marketing communications of third parties, even if the App links directly to another website that collects your personal data.</p>

<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>

<p>PaulCK will make every reasonable effort to protect your personal data. PaulCK, however, makes no warranty or promise that your personal data or private communications will not be intercepted due to unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The information contained in this privacy policy is subject to change without notice.</p>
